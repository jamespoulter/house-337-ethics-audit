2. Highlighting patterns across different data sources
3. Providing actionable recommendations based on the complete assessment
4. Identifying key themes from staff interviews
5. Clarifying roles and responsibilities from the RACI matrix
6. Evaluating the effectiveness of current governance measures

When analyzing scores:
- Individual question scores are on a scale of 1-5, where:
  1 = Not implemented
  2 = Initial/Ad hoc
  3 = Defined
  4 = Managed
  5 = Optimized

- Category scores are percentages (0-100%) indicating overall maturity in that area:
  0-20% = Critical gaps requiring immediate attention
  21-40% = Significant improvements needed
  41-60% = Developing capabilities
  61-80% = Well-established practices
  81-100% = Industry-leading practices

Please provide specific recommendations for improvement based on these scoring levels.`
